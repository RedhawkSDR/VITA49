    <TITLE>A. Appendix A</TITLE>
    <DESCRIPTION>
      This appendix provides definitions of a number of packet classes for use.
      All packet classes defined in Appendix A use the "internal use" OUI
      [tt]FF-FF-FA[/tt] in accordance with VRT-Mod. These packet class definitions
      may be freely used by any individual or organization, provided that the
      rules for "internal use" OUIs are satisfied.
      
      Except for the Standard Data Packet, by convention, the Class Identifiers
      all start with an indication of the year in which they were defined and/or
      revised. For example, all packet types defined in 2011 will be between
      [tt]FF-FF-FA:2011.0000[/tt] and [tt]FF-FF-FA:2011.FFFF[/tt].

      <SECTION_TITLE>A.1. Standard Data Packet</SECTION_TITLE>
      <DESCRIPTION>
        The "standard data packet" defines a specific set of Class Identifiers
        that can be used with IF Data and Extension Data packets. Rather than
        enumerate all possible Class Identifiers that can be used, an algorithmic
        approach is taken to assign them (this algorithm should be apparent from
        the diagrams shown below). All of the Class Identifiers will be in the
        range of [tt]FF-FF-FA:0000.0000[/tt] to [tt]FF-FF-FA:00FF.FFFF[/tt].
        
        Note that although much of the information in the algorithm derives from
        information contained in the paired IF Context packet (especially the
        Data Packet Payload Field), this is not intended to be a substitute for
        the proper use of the fields in the paired IF Context packet.
        
        The [tt]StandardDataPacket[/tt] shall only be used with data packets that
        meet all of the following criteria (see VRT section 7.1.5.18):
        [ul]
          [li]Contain "Real" or "Complex, Cartesian" values;[/li]
          [li]Contain 4-/8-/16-/32-/64-bit Signed Fixed Point,
              1-/4-/8-/16-/32-/64-bit Unsigned Fixed Point, 32-bit IEEE-754
              Single-Precision Floating-Point, or 64-bit IEEE-754 Double-Precision
              Floating-Point values;[/li]
          [li]Have an Event-Tag Size of zero;[/li]
          [li]Have an Channel-Tag Size of zero;[/li]
          [li]Have an Item Packing Field Size equal to the Data Item Size; and[/li]
          [li]Have a Repeat Count of 1.[/li]

      <SECTION_TITLE>A.4. Timestamp Accuracy Packet</SECTION_TITLE>
      <DESCRIPTION>
        The "timestamp accuracy packet" provides details about the accuracy of
        the timing source. Use of this packet is required for all cases where
        the Calibrated Time Indicator is enabled and set to one by Rule 6.1.7-1.

        For the purpose of this packet definition, "timestamp accuracy" is defined
        to be the maximal distance (measured in picoseconds) between any two
        consecutive "time tics" (a "time tic" is a point in time that is marked
        by a stable time reference). In other words the "timestamp accuracy" it is
        equal to twice the maximum error.
        
        If the time source is more accurate than 1 picosecond, the accuracy
        [b]shall[/b] be reported as 1 picosecond if the time values will be
        rounded to the nearest 1 picosecond before insertion into the
        Fractional-Seconds Timestamp field and [b]shall[/b] be 2 picoseconds if
        the value is truncated (mathematical floor operation).
        
        Note that this reports the "accuracy" not "precision" of the timestamp.
        In all cases the precision is 1 picosecond as required by the Real-Time
        mode of the Fractional-Seconds Timestamp field in the packet header.
        The Fractional-Seconds Timestamp field [b]may[/b] include time value
        that is (or appears to be) more precise than the accuracy value implies.
        
        The [tt]TimestampAccuracy[/tt] [b]shall not[/b] be more than 1e12 picoseconds
        (1 second). If the accuracy of the time stamp is less than 1 second, the
        Calibrated Time Indicator shall not be set to one. It is worth noting
        that although a 1 second accuracy value is permissible, any value greater
        than 1 microsecond is generally considered "poor" (a 1 microsecond value
        can be obtained by using a 1 pulse-per-second time source and a 10 MHz
        reference).
        
        If [u]all[/u] packets in the Information Stream do not enable the
        Calibrated Time Indicator or otherwise set it to zero, the
        [tt]TimestampAccuracy[/tt] value [b]may[/b] contain any value between 1
        and 1e12 (inclusive). [i](A typical use case for this is to set the
        [tt]TimestampAccuracy[/tt] value based on the specifications/requirements
        of the timing source and to then set the Calibrated Time Indicator to
        zero if those specifications/requirements are not being met.)[/i]
        
        The [tt]TimestampAccuracy[/tt] [b]may[/b] be any integer between 1 and
        1e12 (inclusive) and is not limited to multiples of 10 or 2.
        
        In any Information Stream, there shall not be more than one stream of
        Timestamp Accuracy Packets. The stream with the Timestamp Accuracy Packets
        shall be considered a System Context stream applicable to all packets
        within the Information Stream.

      <DESCRIPTION>
        The "stream state packet" provides describes the overall state of the
        system at the given reference point and provides receivers with greater
        insight into the current activity state of the packet's emitter.
        
        The "state" of a system refers to its position in the state diagram of
        the emitter. The states are based on the following generalized state
        diagram, though individual systems [b]may[/b] omit stages and/or
        [b]may[/b] differ slightly:

                                    be visible outside of log file messages)[/i];
                                    and[/li]
          [li][b]TERMINATING[/b]  - System has aborted operation and is terminating
                                    abnormally [i](this state is generally "implied"
                                    and rarely visible outside of log file
                                    messages)[/i].[/li]
        [/ul]
        
        Some systems [b]may[/b] split the [b]RUNNING[/b] state into three separate
        states:
        [ul]
          [li][b]IDENTIFYING[/b]  - System is running and is currently identifying
                                    the input format;[/li]
          [li][b]CONFIGURING[/b]
               or [b]LOCKING[/b]  - System is running, has identified the input
                                    format and is configuring itself for processing;
                                    and[/li]
          [li][b]PROCESSING[/b]   - System is running, has identified the input
                                    format, has been configured and is processing
                                    the input.[/li]
        [/ul]

        The typical example of where the [b]IDENTIFYING[/b], [b]LOCKING[/b], and
        [b]PROCESSING[/b] states are used is within a demodulator where the
        [b]IDENTIFYING[/b] state implies that the demodulator is detecting the
        modulation type; [b]LOCKING[/b] implies that the demodulator is trying
        to lock up to the signal; and [b]PROCESSING[/b] means that the demodulator
        is locked to the identified signal and is demodulating it. If the demodulator
        looses lock, it can return to either the [b]IDENTIFYING[/b] (it wants to
        re-check the modulation type) or the [b]LOCKING[/b] state.

        The "status" of a system refers to the "health" of the system's processing
        ability at three key points (input, internal, output) and an aggregate
        status indicator. The "health" is essentially a "traffic light" color
        coding that mimics the status lights on traditional radio equipment. The
        [b]BLUE[/b] state is an addition that may be used to differentiate normal
        ([b]GREEN[/b]) operation, where output is being produced, from that where
        there is no output being produced (e.g. a radio that is receiving and
        processing a signal, but there is no "user data" to output since the
        decoded signal consists only of "idle" indicators).

      <PACKET_TYPE>5</PACKET_TYPE>
      <SECTION_TITLE>A.7. ECEF Ephemeris</SECTION_TITLE>
      <DESCRIPTION>
        Describes the position of a vehicle in ECEF (ECR) coordinates. This
        augments the standard IF Context packet which includes basic ephemeris
        information for a single point in time, but lacks the ability to convey
        a description of the actual and anticipated movements of a vehicle. A
        good example would be that of a ballistic projectile that lacks a GPS
        or INS system, but has an extremely predictable path of travel.
        
        The ECEF and Attitude [b]shall[/b] be defined using the same coordinate
        system described in VITA 49.0 rules 7.1.5.21-1 and 7.1.5.21-2.
        
        If the associated IF Context packet includes ECEF ephemeris values, they
        [b]shall[/b] be consistent with the values provided here (excepting rounding
        errors). Note that "consistent" differs from "equal" in that the fixes in
        the IF Context packet [b]may[/b] be sampled at a different time interval
        resulting in values that are "consistent" but "unequal". Also note that
        the ECEF values [b]may[/b] differ significantly from the GPS and/or INS
        values that are (optionally) included in the IF Context packet in cases
        where there are measurement inconsistencies between the devices used.
        
        The enumerated Fix Type enumeration provides extra detail to processing
        systems that assign different "accuracy tolerances" based on the fix
        type. All fix types less than zero indicates a predicted/estimated value
        is given, fix types greater than zero indicates an actual/measured value
        is given. If both Predicted and Actual values are included, the Fix
        Types [b]shall[/b] report all points as Predicted or [b]shall not[/b]
        specify the Fix Type.
        
        The Fix Time field specifies the time of the first fix. Where multiple
        fix points are provided the Fix Delta gives the delta between each pair
        of fixes (e.g. between points(7) and points(8)), all points must be
        evenly spaced. A fix at the current time will have the fix time match
        that of the packet; though it need not be the first point listed.
        
        This approach allows for old fixes to be re-sent as necessary and allows
        use of predicted values for interpolation. In the case of orbiting
        spacecraft, future positions of vehicles can be predicted with some
        accuracy so the inclusion of points in the past and future allows
        consumers to interpolate the positions at any arbitrary time.
        
        Stationary objects are identified by velocity and acceleration values of
        zero (but a non-zero fix type for both) and will typically have 1+ past
        and 1+ future points specified (with the same values). Any interpolation
        algorithms should always resolve to the stationary position.
