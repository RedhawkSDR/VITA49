  /** <b>A.5.\ Stream State Packet</b>. 
   *  
   *          The "stream state packet" provides describes the overall state of the
   *          system at the given reference point and provides receivers with greater
   *          insight into the current activity state of the packet's emitter.<br><br>
   *  
   *          The "state" of a system refers to its position in the state diagram of
   *          the emitter. The states are based on the following generalized state
   *          diagram, though individual systems <b>may</b> omit stages and/or
   *          <b>may</b> differ slightly:<br><br>

   *  
   *          The states are as follows:
   *          <ul>
   *            <li><b>BOOTING</b>      - System is booting up, but not yet ready for
   *                                      initialization, <i>(this state is generally
   *                                      "implied" and rarely visible outside of log
   *                                      file messages)</i>;</li>
   *            <li><b>INITIALIZING</b> - System is initializing;</li>
   *            <li><b>STARTING</b>     - System has been initialized, and is preparing
   *                                      to run;</li>
   *            <li><b>RUNNING</b>      - System is running, this included situations
   *                                      where the system is waiting for input;</li>
   *            <li><b>STOPPING</b>     - System is done processing (e.g. in response
   *                                      to user input or the result of not having
   *                                      any more data to process) and is stopping;</li>
   *            <li><b>EXITING</b>      - System has completed operation and is exiting
   *                                      normally <i>(this state is generally "implied"
   *                                      and rarely visible outside of log file
   *                                      messages)</i>;</li>
   *            <li><b>PAUSING</b>      - System is pausing, this is generally in
   *                                      response to user input, such as pausing
   *                                      playback of a recorded signal;</li>
   *            <li><b>BREAKING</b>     - System is breaking out of the current running
   *                                      state on its way to a restart;</li>
   *            <li><b>RESTARTING</b>   - System is restarting;</li>
   *            <li><b>ABORTING</b>     - An error event has taking place or an "abort"
   *                                      signal has been sent to the system, and the
   *                                      system is now aborting normal operation <i>(this
   *                                      state can follow any other state and might not
   *                                      be visible outside of log file messages)</i>;
   *                                      and</li>
   *            <li><b>TERMINATING</b>  - System has aborted operation and is terminating
   *                                      abnormally <i>(this state is generally "implied"
   *                                      and rarely visible outside of log file
   *                                      messages)</i>.</li>
   *          </ul><br><br>
   *  
   *          Some systems <b>may</b> split the <b>RUNNING</b> state into three separate
   *          states:
   *          <ul>
   *            <li><b>IDENTIFYING</b>  - System is running and is currently identifying
   *                                      the input format;</li>
   *            <li><b>CONFIGURING</b>
   *                 or <b>LOCKING</b>  - System is running, has identified the input
   *                                      format and is configuring itself for processing;
   *                                      and</li>
   *            <li><b>PROCESSING</b>   - System is running, has identified the input
   *                                      format, has been configured and is processing
   *                                      the input.</li>
   *          </ul><br><br>
   *  
   *          The typical example of where the <b>IDENTIFYING</b>, <b>LOCKING</b>, and
   *          <b>PROCESSING</b> states are used is within a demodulator where the
   *          <b>IDENTIFYING</b> state implies that the demodulator is detecting the
   *          modulation type; <b>LOCKING</b> implies that the demodulator is trying
   *          to lock up to the signal; and <b>PROCESSING</b> means that the demodulator
   *          is locked to the identified signal and is demodulating it. If the demodulator
   *          looses lock, it can return to either the <b>IDENTIFYING</b> (it wants to
   *          re-check the modulation type) or the <b>LOCKING</b> state.<br><br>
   *  
   *          The "status" of a system refers to the "health" of the system's processing
   *          ability at three key points (input, internal, output) and an aggregate
   *          status indicator. The "health" is essentially a "traffic light" color
   *          coding that mimics the status lights on traditional radio equipment. The
   *          <b>BLUE</b> state is an addition that may be used to differentiate normal
   *          (<b>GREEN</b>) operation, where output is being produced, from that where
   *          there is no output being produced (e.g. a radio that is receiving and
   *          processing a signal, but there is no "user data" to output since the
   *          decoded signal consists only of "idle" indicators).
