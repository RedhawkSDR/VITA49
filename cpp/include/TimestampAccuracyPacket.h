  /** <b>A.4.\ Timestamp Accuracy Packet</b>. 
   *  
   *          The "timestamp accuracy packet" provides details about the accuracy of
   *          the timing source. Use of this packet is required for all cases where
   *          the Calibrated Time Indicator is enabled and set to one by Rule 6.1.7-1.<br><br>
   *  
   *          For the purpose of this packet definition, "timestamp accuracy" is defined
   *          to be the maximal distance (measured in picoseconds) between any two
   *          consecutive "time tics" (a "time tic" is a point in time that is marked
   *          by a stable time reference). In other words the "timestamp accuracy" it is
   *          equal to twice the maximum error.<br><br>
   *  
   *          If the time source is more accurate than 1 picosecond, the accuracy
   *          <b>shall</b> be reported as 1 picosecond if the time values will be
   *          rounded to the nearest 1 picosecond before insertion into the
   *          Fractional-Seconds Timestamp field and <b>shall</b> be 2 picoseconds if
   *          the value is truncated (mathematical floor operation).<br><br>
   *  
   *          Note that this reports the "accuracy" not "precision" of the timestamp.
   *          In all cases the precision is 1 picosecond as required by the Real-Time
   *          mode of the Fractional-Seconds Timestamp field in the packet header.
   *          The Fractional-Seconds Timestamp field <b>may</b> include time value
   *          that is (or appears to be) more precise than the accuracy value implies.<br><br>
   *  
   *          The <tt>TimestampAccuracy</tt> <b>shall not</b> be more than 1e12 picoseconds
   *          (1 second). If the accuracy of the time stamp is less than 1 second, the
   *          Calibrated Time Indicator shall not be set to one. It is worth noting
   *          that although a 1 second accuracy value is permissible, any value greater
   *          than 1 microsecond is generally considered "poor" (a 1 microsecond value
   *          can be obtained by using a 1 pulse-per-second time source and a 10 MHz
   *          reference).<br><br>
   *  
   *          If <b>all</b> packets in the Information Stream do not enable the
   *          Calibrated Time Indicator or otherwise set it to zero, the
   *          <tt>TimestampAccuracy</tt> value <b>may</b> contain any value between 1
   *          and 1e12 (inclusive). <i>(A typical use case for this is to set the
   *          <tt>TimestampAccuracy</tt> value based on the specifications/requirements
   *          of the timing source and to then set the Calibrated Time Indicator to
   *          zero if those specifications/requirements are not being met.)</i><br><br>
   *  
   *          The <tt>TimestampAccuracy</tt> <b>may</b> be any integer between 1 and
   *          1e12 (inclusive) and is not limited to multiples of 10 or 2.<br><br>
   *  
   *          In any Information Stream, there shall not be more than one stream of
   *          Timestamp Accuracy Packets. The stream with the Timestamp Accuracy Packets
   *          shall be considered a System Context stream applicable to all packets
   *          within the Information Stream.
