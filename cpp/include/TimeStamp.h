   *  For time values (i.e. the integer time mode is not <tt>None</tt> or <tt>Other</tt>), there are
   *  four different "epochs" that are supported by this class (see below); however all time values
   *  stored within this class will be in UTC or GPS time.<br>
   *  <br>
   *  <h2>UTC <i>(per VITA-49 specification)</i></h2>
   *  This measures number of 1-second clock tics since 1 JAN 1970. Note that the VITA-49
   *  specification is extremely clear on the point that <b>this includes leap seconds</b>. <br>
   *  <br>
   *  <b>This class makes the assumption that only times after 1 JAN 1972 (or zero) are used. This is
   *  important since prior to 1 JAN 1972 the duration of 1 UTC second differed from the definition
   *  used today</b> (since 1 JAN 1972 the duration of 1 UTC second matches the SI, TAI, and GPS
   *  definitions). <b>It is also assumed that exactly 11 leap seconds took place between 1 JAN 1970
   *  and 6 JAN 1980.</b> This "11 leap second" assumption is consistent with the example provided
   *  in IEEE 1588-2008 (see section B.2 of [2]) that shows an 8 leap-second difference between
   *  UTC and TAI on 1 Jan 1970 and the officially-accepted 19 leap-second difference between UTC
   *  and TAI on 1 Jan 1980 (see [4]).
   *  <pre>
   *    1:  LS  = (Leap Seconds Added Between 1 Jan 1970 to 6 Jan 1980)
   *    2:  LS  = (Leap Seconds 1 Jan 1970 to 1 Jan 1980) + (Leap Seconds 1 Jan 1980 to 6 Jan 1980)
   *    3:  LS  = (Leap Seconds 1 Jan 1970 to 1 Jan 1980) +               0
   *    3:  LS  = (Leap Seconds 1 Jan 1970 to 1 Jan 1980)
   *    4:  LS  = (Total Leap Seconds on 1 Jan 1980) - (Total Leap Seconds on 1 Jan 1970)
   *    5:  LS  =                 19                 - (Total Leap Seconds on 1 Jan 1970)
   *    6:  LS  =                 19                 -                  8
   *    7:  LS  =                                    11
   *
   *   3 - by definition no leap seconds are added mid-month
   *   4 - basic expansion
   *   5 - per USNO, see [4]
   *   6 - per IEEE 1588-2008, see [2]
   *  </pre>
   *  Although UTC time includes leap seconds. The number of leap seconds elapsed must still be
   *  looked up every time a conversion is made to another time format and/or a time string
   *  (year-month-day).<br>
   *  <br>
   *  <h2>GPS <i>(per VITA-49 specification)</i></h2>
   *  This measures number of 1-second clock tics since 6 JAN 1980. In practice, this is usually
   *  the most efficient form to use as there is never a need to worry about leap second adjustments.<br>
   *  <br>
   *  <h2>POSIX <i>(in seconds since start of epoch)</i></h2>
   *  The POSIX time is extremely common on most computers, but it is extremely ill-defined. Many
   *  sources say that POSIX time is equal to UTC time, but (especially when represented in
   *  seconds-since-epoch form) that is simply not true. The true POSIX epoch is equal to:
   *  <pre>
   *    POSIX Seconds    =    (days since 1 Jan 1970) * (86,400 sec/day) + (seconds of current day)
   *  </pre>
   *  Note that the above equation differs from UTC time in that, UTC time is not fixed at 86,400
   *  sec/day, but rather can be 86,399 sec/day (subtract a leap second), 86,400 sec/day (normal), or
   *  86,401 sec/day (add a leap second). This implicitly yields:
   *  <pre>
   *    POSIX Seconds    =    (days since 1 Jan 1970) * (86,400 sec/day) + (seconds of current day)
   *                     =    (UTC seconds since 1 JAN 1970) - (UTC leap-seconds since 1 JAN 1970)
   *  </pre>
   *  When a POSIX time it converted to a string (i.e. year-month-day hours:min:sec) it will match
   *  the string for a UTC time ~99.9996% of the time -- this is why people say it is equal to UTC.
   *  Anyone who cares about precision time should be immediately concerned about the ~0.0004% of
   *  the time where it is just plain wrong (~0.0004% matches the 12 times of the year where a
   *  leap-second can be added/removed).<br>
   *  <br>
   *  The most problematic thing with POSIX time is that it contains no information about the number
   *  of leap-seconds that it didn't count. This means that it is impossible to determine the correct
   *  time when at the point of a leap-second insertion and means that basic math on the times won't
   *  suffice to determine the number UTC seconds elapsed between two POSIX time stamps. <br>
   *  <br>
   *  <b>There is a discontinuity in the POSIX time epoch at the point where a leap-second is
   *  added/removed. This class makes no guarantees with regards to the behavior at the point of
   *  the discontinuity and may report the time immediately before or immediately after the
   *  discontinuity (plus any fractional seconds).</b><br>
   *  <br>
   *  <h2>Midas <i>(in seconds since start of epoch)</i></h2><br>
   *  <br>
   *  Midas time is effectively identical to POSIX time but with an epoch starting at 1 Jan 1950,
   *  and with fractional seconds represented as a fraction rather than the number of picoseconds.
   *  <pre>
   *    Midas Seconds    =    (days since 1 Jan 1950) * (86,400 sec/day) + (seconds of current day)
   *                     =    (POSIX Seconds) + (seconds between 1 Jan 1950 and 1 Jan 1970)
   *                     =    (POSIX Seconds) + {@link #MIDAS2POSIX}
   *  </pre>
   *  All conversions to/from Midas time involve an intermediate conversion to/from POSIX time and
   *  are subject to the same issues with respect to leap-seconds.<br>
   *  <br>
   *  The conversion to/from fractional seconds as used in Midas time and picoseconds is simply done
   *  using the following equation:
   *  <pre>
   *    Fractional Sec   =    (number of picoseconds) / (picoseconds in one second)
   *                     =    (number of picoseconds) / {@link #ONE_SEC}
   *  </pre>
   *  <h2>NORAD/IRIG <i>(in seconds since start of current year)</i></h2>
   *  NORAD time is a fairly common one to use, particularly for aerospace-based applications. NORAD
   *  time measures the number of seconds since the start of the current UTC year. IRIG time measures
   *  day-of-year and seconds-of-day (which effectively equates to seconds-of-year after multiplying
   *  day-of-year by 86,400 sec/day).
   *  <pre>

   *      +-----+-----+-----+------+-----------+-----------+
   *                    IRIG Format G (see [1])
   *  </pre>
   *  Unfortunately the NORAD definition is some-what ambiguous as to how mid-year leap-seconds are
   *  handled, while IRIG is ambiguous in application. This leads to two possible definitions for
   *  NORAD (and IRIG-based) time:
   *  <pre>
   *    NORAD Seconds    =    (UTC seconds since start of current year)
   *
   *                  -- OR --
   *
   *    NORAD Seconds    =    (POSIX seconds since start of current year)
   *                     =    ((day of year - 1) * (86,400 sec/day)) + (seconds of current day)           [= IRIG B]
   *                     =    ((day of year - 1) * (86,400 sec/day)) + ((hr * 3600) + (min * 60) + sec)   [= IRIG B/G]
   *                     =    (UTC seconds since start of current year) - (mid-year leap-seconds)
   *  </pre>
   *  IRIG time, as reported, follows the second definition (though it is unclear how the 61st
   *  second is to be reported during a leap-second addition, see section 2.6 of [1]). The issue
   *  with IRIG time is that devices reading the IRIG time will be able to detect the leap second
   *  but will not be able to discern that a mid-year leap-second has taken place by exclusively
   *  looking at the IRIG time reported subsequent to the leap-second addition.<br>
   *  <br>
   *  As of current (Jan 2012), it has been 14+ years since the last mid-year leap second, so there
   *  is little reason to believe that past experience will be a good behavior of future behavior
   *  (14 years being longer than the life-cycle of most equipment.) It fact, it is well-known that
   *  a number of recently-produced devices that read IRIG time and produce a NORAD/UTC time-stamp
   *  differ with regards to their implementation. Accordingly, the NORAD-/IRIG-centric functions
   *  permit the specification of which form to use, and also allow a default to be set at run-time
   *  (see {@link VRTConfig}).<br>
   *  <br>
   *  One of the inherent issues with using NORAD/IRIG time is that it is necessary to separately
   *  provide an indication as to the relevant year. The functions in this class that support a NORAD
   *  to UTC conversion allow the the year to be specified. If the year is given as -1, the following
   *  algorithm is used to derive the year from the local system clock:
   *  <ul>
   *    <li>The current year is taken from the local system clock, which is presumed to be
   *        approximate enough to estimate the current year within a couple days</li>
   *    <li>If a late-December NORAD time is seen in early-January, the previous year is used</li>
   *    <li>If an early-January NORAD time is seen in late-December, the subsequent year is used</li>
   *    <li>Otherwise the current year is used</li>
   *  </ul>
   *  The above algorithm gives a few days leeway to account for cases where data that is
   *  time-stamped at the end of one year (e.g. 31 DEC) does not get processed until the
   *  beginning of the next year (e.g. 1 JAN). It also gives allowances for the local system
   *  to be approximate-at-best rather than being locked to a stable time source; and for
   *  the local system time to be using POSIX time where an end-of-year leap second gives
   *  rise to some ambiguity (see above). <br>
   *  <br>
   *  <b>If the second definition is used, there will be a discontinuity in the NORAD time
   *  epoch at the point where a leap-second is added/removed. This class makes no guarantees
   *  with regards to the behavior at the point of the discontinuity and may report the time
   *  immediately before or immediately after the discontinuity (plus any fractional seconds).</b><br>
   *  <br>
   *  <h2>Precision Time Protocol (PTP)</h2><br>
   *  <br>
   *  PTP is an IEEE standard (see [2]) for clock synchronization among computing devices for
   *  situations where "precision" time is required but where the (direct or indirect) cost
   *  of a GPS receiver is prohibitive.<br>
   *  <br>
   *  PTP provides seconds and nanoseconds referenced to 1 Jan 1970 TAI which differs from
   *  1 Jan 1970 UTC by 8 seconds (see section B.2 of [2]). PTP counts TAI seconds (which are
   *  identical to GPS seconds) and has a fixed reference to GPS time (see section 5.3.3 and
   *  Table B.1 of [2]):
   *  <pre>
   *    GPS Seconds = PTP Seconds - 315,964,819 seconds
   *  </pre>
   *  <br>
   *  <i>Only a basic conversion from PTP is provided. Although it would be viable to
   *  include a PTP reader that connects to the applicable sockets, it is currently
   *  outside the scope of this library.</i><br>
   *  <br>
   *  <h2>HasFields</h2>
   *  The following implementation is used for the {@link HasFields} methods, but
   *  note that since the TimeStamp is immutable they are read-only:
