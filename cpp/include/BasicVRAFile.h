   *
   *    Notes:
   *    [1] The Java "Write" and "ReadWrite" modes share a mode string, and
   *        implement the the "delete existing data" by truncating the file to
   *        zero length immediately after opening.
   *    [2] The C++ write-only ("wb") mode is not explicitly supported since
   *        it would prevent the (optional) setting of the CRC and FileSize
   *        fields in the header. Nor is there explicit support for the C++
   *        append modes ("ab" or "ab+") since they are identical to opening
   *        in ReadWrite mode and then using the append(..) function.
   *    [3] In C++ synchronous writes are implemented via calls to fflush(..)
   *        and fsync(..) or fdatasync(..) following any writes and may not be
   *        available on all systems. <b>In both Java and C++ this feature is
   *        extremely costly since it prevents caching of writes in the O/S or
   *        VM (use only where required).</b>
   *    [4] The C++ modes include the "b" flag indicating binary (as opposed
   *        to text) output is being used. This flag is included for strict
   *        compatibility with the C++ standards although most POSIX systems
   *        ignore it.
