# REDHAWK Basic Components rh.VITA49 shared library
 
## Description

Contains the source and build script for the REDHAWK rh.VITA49 shared library.
 
## Branches and Tags

All REDHAWK core assets use the same branching and tagging policy. Upon release,
the `master` branch is rebased with the specific commit released, and that
commit is tagged with the asset version number. For example, the commit released
as version 1.0.0 is tagged with `1.0.0`.

Development branches (i.e. `develop` or `develop-X.X`, where *X.X* is an asset
version number) contain the latest unreleased development code for the specified
version. If no version is specified (i.e. `develop`), the branch contains the
latest unreleased development code for the latest released version.

## REDHAWK Version Compatibility
